  <!-- AWARENESS & MENTAL HEALTH CONTEXT -->
  <section id="impact">
    <h2>Impact, Awareness & Mental Health</h2>
    <p>
      School shootings affect students, staff, and families beyond physical injuries. Many students exposed to gun violence experience
      anxiety, post-traumatic stress, heightened fear of returning to school, and other lasting emotional effects [6].
    </p>
    <p>
      Studies show that increased exposure to gunfire at schools correlates with higher anxiety rates, trust issues with security environments,
      and a need for comprehensive counseling and community support [6].
    </p>
    <p>
      Educators and school leaders often respond by implementing restorative practices, trauma-informed training, peer support initiatives,
      and partnerships with mental health professionals [6].
