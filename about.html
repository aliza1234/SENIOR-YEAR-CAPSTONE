      This website was created for a Career Vocational Technical Education program Senior Capstone Project. It was created by Aliza Ahmed, a senior in Computer Science, and Web Development and Melody Brien, a senior in Healthcare, to address the ongoing anxiety of gun violence in schools and the need to spread awareness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website itself was designed by Aliza Ahmed and the resources and information was gathered by Melody Brien.
