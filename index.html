    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    <p>
      We strive to raise awareness about school-based gun violence and provide support for students who feel unsafe. Our mission is to create a space where young people can learn, share, and access resources to help them feel secure and supported in their schools.
    </p>
    <h2>The Issue</h2>
    <p>These are results from a survey we sent out.
      <section>
      <img src="pics/Awareness Result.png" alt="Resources Awareness Result" class="awareness-survey-result">
      This shows that a majority of students in Haverhill High School feels that the school doesn't do a good job about spreading awareness for mental health resources.
      </p>
      <p>
      We wanted to be the ones to fix that. </p>

      <section>
      <img src="pics/alicedrills.png" alt="How safe students feel with ALICE Drills" class="awareness-survey-result">
      <p>This is important because the only drills we have in school for intruders are ALICE drills. </p><p>ALICE drills are when, depending on the location of a fake intruder, the students either barricade and hide in their classrooms, or evacuate to a meeting spot near the school (for us it's the hockey rink.) </p><p>This is the practiced multiple times throughout the year, but this doesn't put students at ease according to the survey. Some students said that they feel one meeting spot is dangerous or many people unfortunately don't take the drills seriously enough. Either way, the students generally want to change what we do about shooting threats.
